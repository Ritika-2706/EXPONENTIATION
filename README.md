# Find the exponentiation of a number

## AIM:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Get the input from the user.
2. Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```
/*

Developed by: 
RegisterNumber: 
*/
```
num=int(input())

exp=int(input("Exponentiation of a given number: "))

result=1

for i in range(1,exp+1):

    result=result*num

print(result)



## Output:
![expo1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93427238/151389152-c686f5ee-e97d-4069-853a-4159db35fc4d.PNG)



## Result:
Thus the program to find the exponentiation of a given number is written and verified using python programming.
